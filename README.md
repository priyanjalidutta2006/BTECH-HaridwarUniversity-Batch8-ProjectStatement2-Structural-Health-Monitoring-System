# 🚇 Structural Health Monitoring System for Metro Rail Networks

This project provides a **complete system overview solution** for **structural health monitoring (SHM)** of metro rail networks. It includes a dashboard interface designed using **Figma** to visualize real-time data, identify structural issues, and improve maintenance efficiency using **Design Thinking principles**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**  
Develop a system that enables real-time monitoring of metro rail infrastructure to identify issues (vibration, misalignment, strain, etc.) and display their locations on a dashboard for proactive maintenance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a UI template for a metro rail SHM dashboard
- Display alerts and issue locations using interactive visuals
- Leverage IoT and data analytics to monitor infrastructure health
- Improve decision-making and reduce risk of failure

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 📍 **Metro Map Visualization**: Real-time tracking of issue locations
- 📊 **Sensor Graphs**: Displays vibration trends and other parameters
- 🚨 **Alert Log**: View detailed incident logs with timestamps and severity
- 🏗️ **Station Health Overview**: Individual station status cards
- 🔧 **Settings & Reports**: Custom configuration and downloadable insights

## 📌 UI Design

The UI was designed in **Figma** and follows a clean, modern structure with:
- A sidebar for navigation (Home, Alerts, Reports, etc.)
- Central map for metro network visualization
- Station health cards and alert history
- Graph widgets for key metrics

## 📈 Business Model Canvas & Design Thinking

This project applies Design Thinking methodology:
1. **Empathize** – Understand metro rail authority needs
2. **Define** – Identify real-time SHM issues
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm sensor-based dashboard solutions
4. **Prototype** – Design UI using Figma
5. **Test** – Feedback and refinement
